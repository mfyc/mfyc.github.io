			<h2>Welcome to my first website!</h2>
			<p>
				My name is Monica Chiu and this is my first attempt at a website after some tutorials. <br/>
      				This site is experimental so there will be many random pages where I test out my HTML and
      				CSS skills. <br/> There isn't a set concept or theme throughout the site so it may seem a bit messy
				but bear with me. I will also upload some of my projects and other misc stuff.
			</p>

				Here's <a href="https://github.com/mfyc" target="_blank"> my Github </a> if you're interested.

				Webpage made by <a href="/" target="_blank">[Monica Chiu]</a>.
